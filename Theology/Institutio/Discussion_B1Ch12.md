  Based on the premises of John Calvin's *Institutes of the Christian Religion*, Book 1, Chapter 12, a person who worships idols would be judged on several profound theological grounds. Calvin's argument is built on the nature of God, the nature of true worship, and the inherent sinfulness of humanity's attempts to circumvent God's revealed will.

Here is how someone would be judged according to the logic of this chapter:

### 1. By Willfully Rejecting the True Knowledge of God

Calvin's foundational premise is that God has revealed Himself sufficiently, both through creation (general revelation) and more clearly through Scripture (special revelation). To create and worship an idol is not an innocent mistake; it is an act of **willful ignorance and rebellion**. Instead of conforming their understanding to God as He truly is—an infinite, incomprehensible spirit—the idolater reduces God to a finite, corruptible object of their own creation.

* **Judgment:** The judgment here is for **ingratitude and impiety**. The individual has turned away from the majestic, spiritual God who revealed Himself and has instead embraced a "dull, senseless" fabrication. They are judged for choosing a lie over the truth, dishonoring God by preferring a man-made caricature to His actual glory.

### 2. By Violating God's Express Command

The most direct basis for judgment is the clear prohibition in God's eternal law, specifically the Second Commandment: "You shall not make for yourself a carved image... you shall not bow down to them or serve them" (Exodus 20:4-5). For Calvin, this is not merely a suggestion but a cornerstone of the divine covenant.

* **Judgment:** The judgment is for **direct disobedience and treason against the Divine King**. By transgressing this command, the idolater openly defies God's authority. The act of bowing down to an image is seen as transferring the allegiance, honor, and glory that belong exclusively to the Creator to a mere creature or object. It is a fundamental breach of the relationship between God and humanity.

### 3. By Corrupting the Nature of True Worship

Calvin argues that true worship must be spiritual ($John 4:24$), guided by God's Word, not human invention. Idol worship is the epitome of carnal, man-centered religion. It relies on physical senses and human imagination rather than on faith in the unseen God.

* **Judgment:** The judgment is for **profanity and superstition**. The idolater is condemned for debasing the sacred act of worship. Instead of engaging in the spiritually pure communion ordained by God (through prayer, preaching of the Word, and sacraments), they have substituted it with a profane, self-styled ritual. This corrupts worship from a divine encounter into a human performance.

### 4. By Denying the Exclusive Glory of God

A central theme in Chapter 12 is that all religious honor and reverence (*latria*) belongs to God alone. Calvin forcefully rejects the Catholic distinction between *latria* (worship for God) and *dulia* (veneration for saints/images), arguing that any form of religious reverence given to a creature is an act of robbing God of His due.

* **Judgment:** The judgment is for **sacrilege**. The idolater is guilty of stealing glory from God. By attributing power, sanctity, or worthiness of reverence to an object, they detract from the unique and incommunicable majesty of God. In Calvin's view, God is a "jealous God" who will not share His glory with another (Isaiah 42:8). The judgment is a direct consequence of this divine jealousy, which is the righteous protection of His own honor.

### Summary of Judgment

In essence, from the perspective of *Institutes* 1.12, a person who worships idols is not judged merely for bowing to a statue. They are judged for a comprehensive and catastrophic theological failure:

* They have **rejected** the true God for a false one.
* They have **disobeyed** His clear command.
* They have **corrupted** the very essence of worship.
* They have **stolen** the glory that belongs to God alone.

Therefore, the judgment is for idolatry as the ultimate expression of human sin: the prideful attempt to create God in our own image, to control Him, and to worship on our own terms rather than on His. It is a fundamental act of unfaithfulness that places the creature at the center of religion, thereby displacing the Creator, which merits divine condemnation.
