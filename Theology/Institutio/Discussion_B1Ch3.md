<li>Regarding chapter 3, if knowledge of God is instilled naturally, what about atheists? </li>

According to John Calvin's argument, **true atheists do not actually exist.** He would argue that a person who professes atheism is not someone who lacks the innate sense of God (*sensus divinitatis*), but rather someone who is actively and willfully suppressing that knowledge.

### ## Suppression, Not Absence

The core of Calvin's response to the question of atheism is that it's a form of **self-deception** rooted in a desire to escape God's moral authority. The innate knowledge of God comes with a sense of accountability, which a guilty conscience wants to flee. Therefore, the atheist engages in a desperate, but ultimately futile, attempt to erase this internal awareness.

Calvin makes a few key points to support this:
* **Forced Speeches:** He sees outspoken atheism not as a calm, reasoned position, but as a kind of forced "belching forth" of rebellious speeches. It's an attempt to convince oneself as much as it is to convince others. He argues it's an unnatural state that requires constant effort to maintain against the inner testimony of the conscience.
* **The Foxhole Argument:** Calvin famously observes that those who are the most arrogant mockers of God in times of peace and comfort are often the most terrified when faced with danger or death. In moments of extreme crisis, the suppressed knowledge rushes back to the surface, and they tremble at the thought of the very God they claimed not to believe in. This involuntary reaction, he argues, reveals the true knowledge that was there all along.
* **Intellectual Rebellion:** From this perspective, atheism is not an intellectual default position but an intellectual rebellion. It is the culmination of the process described in Romans 1:21: "For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened." It is a deliberate exchange of the truth for a lie, driven by a desire to be autonomous.
In short, for Calvin, the existence of people who *call* themselves atheists doesn't disprove the innate knowledge of God. Instead, it serves as a primary example of humanity's sinful and desperate attempt to **flee from a truth that is inescapably stamped on the human soul.** They are not without the knowledge; they are at war with it.
